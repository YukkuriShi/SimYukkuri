Changelog:
	1.12.2

Odds of kotatsu and aquatic marisa appearing from breeding have been reduced
You can no longer purchase Aquatic Marisa, Kotatsu Marisa or Kimeemaru (from marisa and Ayaya types)
  These yukkuris can still be bred.  This is to add incentive to breed yukkuri and in preperation of funding systems.
 Sanae can only be produced with at least one suwako parent.
  Hybrids no longer have a 50% chance of giving birth to hybrids themselves.
  Ayaya probability reduced in favor of kimeemaru
When pregnant, reimu requires less food (about 25% less) than other yukkuri types.
Marisa has a higher than average strength.
Shell Marisa has had her speed heavily reduced, making her more vulnerable, especially when young
Kotatsu Marisa has relatively low health
Aquatic Marisa now likes water
Tenko's health increased significantly
Added "Sell Yukkuri" tool
Added realtime sale value of selected yukkuri to menu.
Grammar fix in resolution menu.
