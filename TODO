TODO

1. Fix the class paths when adding random yukkuri (in myPane) (Issue seems to result from the separation of the yukkuri types.)
2. Deibus okazari placement is off when she is set to use DEIBU instead of DEFAULT
	Resize okazari based on age. - FIXED (leaving as a reminder to check for bugs)
3. Cleanup StealOkazariEvent
	in bodylogic add handling for stealing from living yukkuri
	lower odds of this event occurring.
	because of changes in the drawing method for accessories, we need to either setup a seperate drawing method for trash accessories, or fix the sprites themselves.
	
Check the frequency of refreshing since it got messed up by decreasing max hunger
	alter hunger values so less starving to death with food
	wakeup yukkuri that are starving, this is what leads to most frustrating deaths.
